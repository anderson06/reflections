When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I want to use a remote repo when working on a tema where developers work on the same code base.
A remote repo is also useful for working in the same project in different machines.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This is the best way to avoid dealing with conflicts at random times.
