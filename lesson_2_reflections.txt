What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This command tells git to create a repository from the actual directory, so it creates a hidden directory to keep metadata.

Remember:

One commit per logical change.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is where git keeps info about the files I want to go in the next commit. With it I can better organize my commits, so instead of put all new/edited files in one commit, I can split them into many commits organized by logical changes to the project itself.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Even if I have edited many files at once and these editions are no related logically, I am able to organize my commits with the help of staging area. I can add to the staging area only those files envolved in a logical change and then commit these changes with a descritive message, and then do the same with the other changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When I whant to make some experiment, like adding an feature that I don't know if it's going to work. 
Or keep a version of code that I know it's working as expected. And so on.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

With diagrams I can easily visualy where branches are located in history and navigate through them so I can merge them.
